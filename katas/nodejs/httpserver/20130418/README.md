# http server kata #

A kata to create an http server to inform its status.

It is based in the previous day case (which I didn't do properly because I got stuck trying to find all the tools I use in testing and development).

The case is not an echo, but just a response. The new bits are around how to test it from node itself, instead of using curl.

I made a lot of mistakes, but I think a learnt a few bits and pieces for the next attempt.
