# Computer katas #

I was reading a few articles some time ago about people doing programming katas (I watched some videos too).

Although I liked the idea, I was not sure if what I saw is good for me. Most seems to be attacking a new problem every time, and trying to solve it in different ways.

Years ago I trained a bit on martial arts and fighting, and realized the benefits of practicing a few techniques over and over until I don't need to think about what I am doing, I believe it might be a good idea to follow the same approach about programming.

Currently I am trying to become proficient in NodeJS, and it is a departure from C# big enough to make me nervous most of the time. What could be better than kill that nervousness with practice?

My approach will be to take a single problem, get a working solution, and then repeat it every day until I can do it without thinking about what am I doing. Then it will be time to look for a new problem.

Adding the fact that I am out of Windows now, and not even using an IDE, my learning experience should be benefited from more than one angle.

And it is a great way to start the morning with a success (instead of checking the emails as soon as I seat at my desktop).
